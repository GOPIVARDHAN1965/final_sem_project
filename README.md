	So we are going to do a project that includes multiple domains like web scraping, data science, and web development.

To be more descriptive, our project is going to take the users' spending analytics from any UPI transaction app and prepare a suggestion model for them. We have to develop it into a mobile app as well as a desktop app.
Some of the pages or features of the application will be as follows:
1. Spending Analysis 
2. Reports 
3. Suggestions 

Needed: Tech Stack
Data Science (needs to understand a variety of algorithms)
Web Application Development
Techniques for extracting content from multiple sources
Frontend for interactive applications


Applications of the products we create:
Imagine that after visiting a store or something to make our purchases, we finally make our way to the counter to pay. People these days tend to favor UPI transactions on a regular basis. We are now performing our function in this situation. While the user is making the payment, we gather the information from the bill, store it in a database (which we create for each unique number), and build multiple models to offer better suggestions so that users can find better deals and prices on the same products, or they can find the same products under different brands. 
Additionally, consider the strength of the application we're going to develop. With the help of the user data, we can create insightful analysis each time a payment is made, allowing us to provide more useful recommendations. for instance, retail outlets for raw materials, wholesale markets. everywhere, actually. Additionally, we can assist people in completely digitizing their billing processes so that everyone becomes accustomed to managing digital bills and gains more knowledge about which products to sell at what margins in order to generate profits for their own businesses.
